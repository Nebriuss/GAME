You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
Darkened Storage Room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Boxes and papers tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
darkened storage room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Boxes and papers tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

You can see Carboard box here.

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you attempt to observe the area, spying a red exit sign further north softly glowing. It's a much-needed beacon of hope after the terror of the day. Hesitating for a moment, you make a run for it, the light getting closer,

and closer…


Until you hear a faint click echo throughout the room. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. It's enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the colorful curiosities around, displayed like they would be in a museum.

For a moment, you take in the sights of the shimmering yellow light, plants and flowers spiraling up and around the walls and floor of the room seemingly inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky are strung from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A bear rears up on its hind legs, a salmon caught in its jaws. A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are dead, so very dead. 
 And in the middle of it all is a man. He's older, salt-and-pepper hair running down his back, flannel shirt loosely hanging. He's tightly grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

Babbling in disbelief, he squats down, stance wide and staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, and the whole world stops for a moment before he shouts,

"RABBIT!!!!!"

run, NOW!!

Your antlers ram into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
Darkened Storage Room

You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Boxes and papers tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

Never, in your whole life, has the air tasted so stale and dead.

Your body slowly acclimates to the scene. The cold, hardened ground holds you firm for a moment; both unfamiliar and hostile. This predicament- a dreadful, ironclad grip on your hammering heart- is one you've been taught to be wary of your entire life. Imprisonment in the name of corrupt glory- the kind the pursuit of wealth brings about.

Thin blades of artificial light slice through the bars of your cage. Nothing feels real- you wish it wasn't.

Almost all is silent. The unreliable ticking of a dying clock echoes through the room. There seems to be nothing here you can commit your faith to- you'll have to find your own way.

Who are you, anyways? Take a look at youtself.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you attempt to observe the area, spying a red exit sign further north softly glowing. Hesitating for a moment, you make a run for it, its light getting closer,

and closer…


Until you hear a faint click echo throughout the room. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. It's enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the colorful curiosities displayed around,.

You momentarily take in the sights of the shimmering yellow light, plants and flowers spiraling up and around the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A bear rears up on its hind legs, a salmon in its jaws. A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. He's older, salt-and-pepper hair running down his neck, flannel shirt loosely hanging. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, stance wide and staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts, 
 "RABBIT!!!!!"

run, NOW!!

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
Darkened Storage Room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Various boxes, small and large, are scattered about on the ground.

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.

You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that? 

A single metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

Hall of Wonder
This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

Never, in your whole life, has the air tasted so stale and dead.

Your body slowly acclimates to the scene. The cold, hardened ground holds you firm for a moment; both unfamiliar and hostile. This predicament- a dreadful, ironclad grip on your hammering heart- is one you've been taught to be wary of your entire life. Imprisonment in the name of corrupt glory- the kind the pursuit of wealth brings about.

Thin blades of artificial light slice through the bars of your cage. Nothing feels real- you wish it wasn't.

Almost all is silent. The unreliable ticking of a dying clock echoes through the room. There seems to be nothing here you can commit your faith to- you'll have to find your own way.

Who are you, anyways? Take a look at yourself.

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.

You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

What you'd failed to notice, hidden among his collection, was a man.

He's in his pajamas (must be nice), grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

With you now in his line of sight, he squats down, staring like he'd seen a unicorn. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. The type of bougie guy with one of those evil villain mustaches. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a longer route westbound of the room.

Plaques &amp; Papers
To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprehensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

Hall of Wonder
This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

You can go back now or make a run north for it- either way, this isn't looking too good.

Without wasting another second, you dash to the left, avoiding the center of the room and manuevering through the taixdermied animals, using them as protection agaist detection. They shield you from their own fate.

It's a good thing you went this way.. you can now see a hunter standing in the middle of the room, confused as to why the lights came on.

Exiting Concealed
Using the westbound route, you continue.

As you continue towards the exit, you find a note on the floor. Hidden from The Hunter, you quickly read it. To those who read this: You've made it far, and you don't know me. But, I can tell you this- You were never alone. I weakened the loose bar, another placed the chair. Someone was made to survive this- and it must be you. Every animal made it possible, and now I will tell you with finality- the exit at the end of the room is locked. Check the ground. A switch is there.

You can also see a Switch here.

Ring of Fire
What you'd failed to notice, hidden among his collection, was a hunter.

He's in his pajamas (must be nice), grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

With you now in his line of sight, he squats down, staring like he'd seen a unicorn. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"


RUN! Whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning.

He's in his pajamas (must be nice), grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

With you now in his line of sight, he squats down, staring like he'd seen a unicorn. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"


run, NOW!!

Hall of Wonder
This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

Plaques &amp; Papers
To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprehensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

A single metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. The type of bougie guy with one of those evil villain mustaches. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"

This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

He's in his pajamas (must be nice), grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

With you now in his line of sight, he squats down, staring like he'd seen a unicorn. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,

This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers. If you squint, you can see a vent on the wall to the north. Could you somehow reach that?

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. The type of bougie guy with one of those evil villain mustaches. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that? 

A single metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you attempt to observe the area, spying a red exit sign further north softly glowing. Hesitating for a moment, you make a run for it, its light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint click echo throughout the room. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. It's enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the colorful curiosities displayed around,.

You momentarily take in the sights of the shimmering yellow light, plants and flowers spiraling up and around the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. He's older, hair greying. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"

run, NOW!!

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
Darkened storage room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Various boxes, small and large, are scattered about on the ground.

Darkened Storage Room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Various boxes, small and large, are scattered about on the ground.

Hall of Wonder
This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

With you now in his line of sight, he squats down, staring like he'd seen a unicorn. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.

You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Various boxes, small and large, are scattered about on the ground.

Never, in your whole life, has the air tasted so stale and dead.

Your body slowly acclimates to the scene. The cold, hardened ground holds you firm for a moment; both unfamiliar and hostile. This predicament- a dreadful, ironclad grip on your hammering heart- is one you've been taught to be wary of your entire life. Imprisonment in the name of corrupt glory- the kind the pursuit of wealth brings about.

Thin blades of artificial light slice through the bars of your cage. Nothing feels real- you wish it wasn't.

Almost all is silent. The unreliable ticking of a dying clock echoes through the room. There seems to be nothing here you can commit your faith to- you'll have to find your own way.

Who are you, anyways? Take a look at youtself.

Hall of Wonder
This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.
