Age of Rage
An Interactive Fiction by Ava Morgan
Release 1 / Serial number 251008 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Never, in your whole life, has the air tasted so stale and dead.

Your body slowly acclimates to the scene. The cold, hardened ground holds you firm for a moment; both unfamiliar and hostile.
 
This predicament- a dreadful, ironclad grip on your hammering heart- is one you've been taught to be wary of your entire life. Imprisonment in the name of corrupt glory- the kind the pursuit of wealth brings about.

Thin blades of artificial light slice through the bars of your cage. Nothing feels real- you wish it wasn't.

Almost all is silent. The unreliable ticking of a dying clock echoes through the room. There seems to be nothing here you can commit your faith to.

Try LOOKING at yourself or the cage.


Awakening (in the cage)
The cage is dismal and dim, with nothig to note, unless...? Look closer.

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
Darkened Storage Room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Boxes and papers tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

To the east, empty glass display cases line the wall, one of which is smashed, possibly targeted in a robbery of some sort. You stop yourself just before stepping directly into a pile of glass shards. When was this place last cleaned?

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you attempt to observe the area, spying a red exit sign further north softly glowing. It's a much-needed beacon of hope after the terror of the day. Hesitating for a moment, you make a run for it, the light getting closer,

and closer…


Until you hear a faint click echo throughout the room. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. It's enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the colorful curiosities around, displayed like they would be in a museum.

For a moment, you take in the sights of the shimmering yellow light, plants and flowers spiraling up and around the walls and floor of the room seemingly inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky are strung from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A bear rears up on its hind legs, a salmon caught in its jaws. A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are dead, so very dead. 
 And in the middle of it all is a man. He's older, salt-and-pepper hair running down his back, flannel shirt loosely hanging. He's tightly grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

Babbling in disbelief, he squats down, stance wide and staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, and the whole world stops for a moment before he shouts,

"RABBIT!!!!!"

run, NOW!!

Your antlers ram into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.

You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Boxes and papers tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Plaques &amp; Papers
To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

Never, in your whole life, has the air tasted so stale and dead.

Your body slowly acclimates to the scene. The cold, hardened ground holds you firm for a moment; both unfamiliar and hostile. This predicament- a dreadful, ironclad grip on your hammering heart- is one you've been taught to be wary of your entire life. Imprisonment in the name of corrupt glory- the kind the pursuit of wealth brings about.

Thin blades of artificial light slice through the bars of your cage. Nothing feels real- you wish it wasn't.

Almost all is silent. The unreliable ticking of a dying clock echoes through the room. There seems to be nothing here you can commit your faith to- you'll have to find your own way.

Who are you, anyways? Take a look at youtself.

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you attempt to observe the area, spying a red exit sign further north softly glowing. Hesitating for a moment, you make a run for it, its light getting closer,

and closer…


Until you hear a faint click echo throughout the room. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. It's enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the colorful curiosities displayed around,.

You momentarily take in the sights of the shimmering yellow light, plants and flowers spiraling up and around the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A bear rears up on its hind legs, a salmon in its jaws. A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. He's older, salt-and-pepper hair running down his neck, flannel shirt loosely hanging. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, stance wide and staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts, 
 "RABBIT!!!!!"

run, NOW!!

You inspect the cage floor and gently sneeze, stirring up a clump of dust in the corner of the cage. It slips through the bars effortlessly. Unbelievable.

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
Darkened storage room

Never, in your whole life, has the air tasted so stale and dead.

Your body slowly acclimates to the scene. The cold, hardened ground holds you firm for a moment; both unfamiliar and hostile. This predicament- a dreadful, ironclad grip on your hammering heart- is one you've been taught to be wary of your entire life. Imprisonment in the name of corrupt glory- the kind the pursuit of wealth brings about.

Thin blades of artificial light slice through the bars of your cage. Nothing feels real- you wish it wasn't.

Almost all is silent. The unreliable ticking of a dying clock echoes through the room. There seems to be nothing here you can commit your faith to- you'll have to find your own way.

Who are you, anyways? Take a look at yourself.

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
Darkened storage room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Various boxes, small and large, are scattered about on the ground.

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that? 

A single metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you attempt to observe the area, spying a red exit sign further north softly glowing. It's a much-needed beacon of hope after the terror of the day. Hesitating for a moment, you make a run for it, the light getting closer,

and closer…


 Until you hear a faint click echo throughout the room. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. It's enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the colorful curiosities around, displayed like they would be in a museum.

For a moment, you take in the sights of the shimmering yellow light, plants and flowers spiraling up and around the walls and floor of the room seemingly inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky are strung from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

… A bear rears up on its hind legs, a salmon caught in its jaws. A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are dead, so very dead. 
 And in the middle of it all is a man. He's older, salt-and-pepper hair running down his back, flannel shirt loosely hanging. He's tightly grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

Babbling in disbelief, he squats down, stance wide and staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, and the whole world stops for a moment before he shouts,

"RABBIT!!!!!"

run, NOW!!"

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. The type of bougie guy with one of those evil villain mustaches. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a longer route westbound of the room.

This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

Hall of Wonder
This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

You can go back now or make a run north for it- either way, this isn't looking too good.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

Hall of Wonder
This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. The type of bougie guy with one of those evil villain mustaches. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. The type of bougie guy with one of those evil villain mustaches. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"


run, NOW!!

You can go back now or make a run north for it- either way, this isn't looking too good.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. You have to make a run north for it..!

To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

You squeeze into the rusty vent, tip-toeing forward. At the end is an opening, and you carefully hop out.

Hall of Wonder

Though dark, you attempt to observe the area, spying a red exit sign further north softly glowing. Hesitating for a moment, you make a run for it, its light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint click echo throughout the room. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. It's enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the colorful curiosities displayed around,.

You momentarily take in the sights of the shimmering yellow light, plants and flowers spiraling up and around the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

And in the middle of it all is a man. He's older, hair greying. He's grasping a bottle of alcohol- and, glancing at you once, twice, he downs the rest of it and tosses it.

He squats down, staring like he'd seen god himself. He shakily raises his finger, the whole world stopping for a moment before he shouts,


"RABBIT!!!!!"

run, NOW!!

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

Never, in your whole life, has the air tasted so stale and dead.

Your body slowly acclimates to the scene. The cold, hardened ground holds you firm for a moment; both unfamiliar and hostile. This predicament- a dreadful, ironclad grip on your hammering heart- is one you've been taught to be wary of your entire life. Imprisonment in the name of corrupt glory- the kind the pursuit of wealth brings about.

Thin blades of artificial light slice through the bars of your cage. Nothing feels real- you wish it wasn't.

Almost all is silent. The unreliable ticking of a dying clock echoes through the room. There seems to be nothing here you can commit your faith to- you'll have to find your own way.

Who are you, anyways? Take a look at youtself.

Darkened Storage Room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Various boxes, small and large, are scattered about on the ground.

Hall of Wonder
This new room is also dark, but you spy a red exit sign further north glowing softly. You make a run for it, the light getting closer...

Until you hear a faint clicking sound. Blinding and bold, a beam of light strikes you from above, and then, like a twisted domino effect, each section of the room slowly comes to life. Its enormous, the exit sign's glow now washed away by the curious sights around you.

Plants and flowers spiral up the walls of the room, inspired by the outside world. Tapestries resembling a perfect blue sky hang from the ceiling. A lion gazes into the distance, surveying its kingdom.

…A hawk swoops down, talons searching for prey. A mighty moose stamps the ground, a warning to those in its way. But they are all dead, so very dead.

Going back would be an option if it wasn't for the sudden bang behind you signaling that the dusty vent had collapsed inwards. Going North seems like your best option, but there's a more discreet route westbound of the room.

Plaques &amp; Papers
To the north are stacks of metal chairs and wooden slabs, golden engravings nailed into each of them. Papers with incomprhensible scrawls are scattered all over the floor. Photographs of animals are attached to some of the papers

One metal chair has fallen from the stack and is on the floor.

If you squint, you can also see a vent on the wall. Could you somehow reach that?

You ram your antlers into the loose loose bar, and it shatters into shimmering shards. A hole you can slip through is now in its place. Wriggling your way through the hole, you quietly slink around the cage and look forward.
 
Darkened Storage Room
You now have a slightly better view of the room, and get a full idea of just how large the room is compared to you. Stacks of paper tower imposingly above. There are three sections of the room with items scattered about to the north, east, and west respectively.

Various boxes, small and large, are scattered about on the ground.
